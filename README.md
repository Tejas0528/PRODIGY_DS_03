 Task: Predict Customer Purchase Behavior using Decision Tree Classifier

 Description

This project involves building a simple Decision Tree Classifier from scratch (without using sklearn) to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and behavioral data from the Bank Marketing dataset.

ðŸ§  Key Concepts Covered

Entropy and Information Gain Calculation

Manual Data Preprocessing

Basic Train/Test Split

Simple Decision Tree Logic (One-Level Tree)

Prediction and Accuracy Calculation

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Math

ðŸ“Š Dataset Features Used
age

job

marital

education

y (target: has the client subscribed to a term deposit)

The full dataset has more columns, but this task uses a simplified subset for easier understanding.

ðŸš€ How It Works
Load and clean the dataset

Encode categorical variables manually

Split data into training and test sets

Calculate entropy and find best split

Make predictions using the best split rule

Evaluate model accuracy

 Learnings
 
How decision trees decide splits

What entropy and information gain mean

How to preprocess data manually

The importance of clean and interpretable models

 Future Improvements
 
Implement a recursive full-depth decision tree

Add Gini Impurity as an alternative to entropy

Expand to Random Forests

Add visualization of the decision tree
